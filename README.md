# Developer Rubric

This repository holds Sema's Developer Rubric, a self-assessment tool you can use to measure your current place in your development journey.

## Using the Rubric

We offer the rubric in three different forms:

- The markdown rubric is meant to be human-readable, so you can share it with your colleagues.
- The JSON rubric is designed for automation, so you can integrate it into your workflows and onboarding processes.
- The CSV rubric is the **single source of truth**. Any changes to the rubric should be made on this file, which will then be converted to the other formats via automation.
